### Hi there. Lovely to meet you. 👋

#### I lead happy and efficient teams. I design, code, and ship useful things.

I have 25 years of experience across multiple disciplines including leadership, product design, product management, and front-end development. I'm known for my positive attitude, the ability to create and ship products, and for keeping colleagues unstuck.

I prioritize opportunities to work on things that uplift and empower people. I'm passionate about design systems, emerging technologies, team building, and mentorship. I care deeply about video games, music, politics, healthcare, and education.
