### Hi there. Lovely to meet you. ðŸ‘‹

#### I lead happy and efficient teams. I design, code, and ship useful things.

I'm known for my positive attitude, ability to create and ship products, and keep colleagues unstuck. I bring over 25 years of multi-disciplinary experience in leadership, product design, product management, and front-end development.

I prioritize opportunities to work on things that uplift and empower people. I love using design and technology to bring things to life. I enjoy trying new things and working outside of my comfort zone. I'm passionate about team building, mentorship, design systems, and emerging technologies. I care deeply about video games, music, politics, healthcare, and education. Ideally, I'm working on a magical combination of the above.
