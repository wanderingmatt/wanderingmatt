### Hi there. Lovely to meet you. 👋

#### I lead happy and efficient teams. I design, code, and ship useful things.

I'm known for my positive attitude and keeping colleagues unstuck. I choose to work on things that uplift and empower people. I'm passionate about video games, music, and comics. I thrive on mentorship, design systems, and building teams that stick around.

Canadian. Coffee snob.
